			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Laurinburg, NC and moved to Charlotte when I was three years old. After graduating from college I lived in Philadelphia, PA for five years before returning to Charlotte in 2006.</li>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Professional Background:</strong> I moved to Philadelphia to become a day trader, but that didn’t work out. When I moved back to Charlotte I got a job in the restaurant industry, where I have worked since. I now have a game day job with the NFL monitoring the tablets players and coaches use on the sidelines.</li>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Academic Background:</strong>  I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a chemistry degree. I knew before finishing I didn’t want to work in that field, but tuition was rising at such a rate that I had to complete that degree because I was so close to finishing. I enrolled at CPCC in 2016 and have since earned AAS Networking Technologies and AAS Digital Forensics degrees</li>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Background in this subject:</strong> I didn’t have a computer in my home before college. My freshman year roommate’s dad worked for IBM, and we were one of the few rooms to have a PC. Until I began my studies at CPCC, I was just literate enough to browse the file system. My first experience with the Internet was text-only, mainly looking up lyrics to Weird Al songs on Gopher. </li>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  Windows 10</li>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Courses I'm Taking, & Why:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>CSC 121 - Python Programming&mdash;This course is required for my current degree.</li>
					<li>CSC 251 - Advanced Java Programming&mdash;I'm taking CSC 154 for the same reason as above.</li>
					<li>WEB 140 - Web Development Tools&mdash;I'm taking CSC 154 for the same reason as above..</li>
					<li>WEB 210 - Web Design&mdash;Always keep learning.</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="no_bullet"><strong class="list-item">Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong>  I was a poster child. The reason this is interesting is that I am not differently abled.  My mom worked for an advertising agency, and a fraternity at UNCC was starting a program to help local children who were differently abled. I happened to be in the office the day they met to discuss scheduling the photo session for the poster and the fraternity’s representative liked my look, I guess. They put leg braces on me for the first part of the shoot, and the photographer, who didn’t see me walk in without them earlier, was shocked when I got up and ran around when we were done!</li>
