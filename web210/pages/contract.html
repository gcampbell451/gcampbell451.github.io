	<h2>Gregory Campbell</h2>
	<h3>Course Contract</h3>
	I, <a href="introduction.html">Gregory C. Campbell</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2021 WEB215 Web Markup and Scripting class with my 
		instructor, D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
	I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put
		information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
	I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such failure to turn in	
		assignments may show as an absence.<br><br>
	Signed, Gregory C. Campbell, 11 January 2021.
