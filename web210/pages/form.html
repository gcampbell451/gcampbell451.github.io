        <textarea id="academicBackground" rows="10" cols="50" class="inputField center" required>I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a chemistry degree. I knew before finishing I didn’t want to work in that field, but tuition was rising at such a rate that I had to complete that degree because I was so close to finishing.

        <textarea id="backgroundInSubject" rows="10" cols="50" class="inputField center" required> I didn’t have a computer in my home before college. My freshman year roommate’s dad worked for IBM, and we were one of the few rooms to have a PC. Until I began my studies at CPCC, I was just literate enough to browse the file system. My first experience with the Internet was text-only, mainly looking up lyrics to Weird Al songs on Gopher.</textarea><br>

        <label for="interesting" class="inputLabel center">Funny/Interesting Item About Yourself:</label><br>
        <textarea id="interesting" rows="10" cols="50" class="inputField center" required>I was a poster child. The reason this is interesting is that I am not differently abled.  My mom worked for an advertising agency, and a fraternity at UNCC was starting a program to help local children who were differently abled. I happened to be in the office the day they met to discuss scheduling the photo session for the poster and the fraternity’s representative liked my look, I guess. They put leg braces on me for the first part of the shoot, and the photographer, who didn’t see me walk in without them earlier, was shocked when I got up and ran around when we were done!</textarea><br>
