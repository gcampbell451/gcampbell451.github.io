	<h2 class="center" id="toc_h2">Gregory Campbell | WEB 250 Course Contract</h2> 
	<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Gregory C. Campbell</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2022 WEB250 Database Driven Websites class with my 
		instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
	<p>I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put
		information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such failure to turn in	
		assignments may show as an absence</p>
	<p>Signed, <em>Gregory C. Campbell, 10 January 2022.</em></p>
