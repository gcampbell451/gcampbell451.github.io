	<!-- Chapter 11 -->
	
	<h3>Chapter 11&mdash;Comparison Operators</h3>
	<p>Often we need to compare two things. These items to compare could be variables, strings, numbers, expressions, or any combination
	   of these. To do so,we use <strong>comparison operators</strong>.</p>
	<p>When comparing strings, we use the comparison operator<strong> ===</strong>. This case-sensitive operator determines whether two strings or 
	   the string values stored in memory for two variables are equal. T</p>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
	The code is:<br><br>
	if (question1 === question1a) <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The strings you entered are identical.");<br>
	}<br><br>
	<strong>Click the button to compare two strings:</strong>
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap11();">Compare</button><br><br>
	If we use the comparison operator <strong>!==</strong> we check to see if two strings are not equal.<br><br> The following code differs from the 
	previous only in using !==:
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap11a();">Compare</button><br><br>
	There are other comparison operators you are likely familiar with:
	<ul>
		<li><strong> &gt;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;is greater than</li>
		<li><strong> &lt;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;is less than</li>
		<li><strong>&gt;=</strong>  &nbsp;is greater than or equal to</li>
		<li><strong>&lt;=</strong>  &nbsp;is less than or equal to</li>
	</ul>
	Using comparison operators in an expression returns a <strong>boolean</strong> value.
	
	<!-- Chapter 12 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 12&mdash;<em>If...else</em> and <em>else if</em> Statements</h3>
	<p>Up to this point, the <em>if</em> statements we have written have been binary&mdash;either the first condition was true and one statement
	   executed or it was false and nothing happened. Sometimes we want to have different statements execute based on the boolean values of 
	   condition evaluation. For this, we use <em>if...else</em> and <em>else if</em> statements.</p>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
		The code is:<br><br>
	if (question1 === question1a) {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The strings you entered are identical.");<br>
	} <strong>else</strong> {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The strings you entered are not identical")<br>
	}<br><br>
	<strong>Click the button to compare two strings:</strong>
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap12();">Compare</button><br><br>
	We can check any number of conditions. After the if... statement, we can use <em>else if</em> to branch other conditions, using <em>else</em>
	only at the final condition to check.
	
	<!-- Chapter 13 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 13&mdash;Testing Sets of Conditions</h3>
	<p>The statements we examined in Chapter 12 tested for one condition only: true or false. What if we wanted to test two conditions in order
	   for a statement to execute? We can use the operators <strong>&&</strong> and/or <strong>||</strong>. <strong>&&</strong> translates to 
	   <strong>and</strong> and <strong>||</strong> translates to <strong>or</strong>.</p>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
	   <p>The code is:<br><br>
	   if (question1 &lt; question1a && question1 &lt; 10) {<br>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The first number you entered is less than 10 and is smaller than the second.");<br>
	   else if (question1 == question1a && question1 &lt; 10) {<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The numbers you entered are identical and both are less than 10.");<br>
	   } else if (question1 == question1a && question1 &gt; 10) {<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The numbers you entered are identical and both are greater than 10.");<br>
	   } else if (question1 == question1a && question1 == 10) {<br>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The numbers you entered identical and each is 10.");<br>
	   } else {<br>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert("The first number you entered is greater than 10 and is larger than the second.");<br>
	   }<br><br>
	<strong>Click the button to compare two numbers:</strong>
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap13();">Compare</button></p><br><br>
	When using the <strong>||</strong> operator, if any one of the conditions being tested returns true, the operation evaluates as true. Only 
	when both conditions are false does the operation evaluate as false. We can combine any number of and and or conditions but we should remember
	the lessons of <a href="swtl_1-10.html#Ch7" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a> and use parentheses to eliminate ambiguity.
	
	<!-- Chapter 14 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 14&mdash;<em>If</em> Statements Nested</h3>
	<p>In a situation like the above code where we wish to test multiple conditions for truth, we can alternatively <em>nest</em> if statements.</p>
		<h4>Example:</h4>
		Say we have this code:
		<pre>
		if(num1%2=0 && num2%2=0 && num3%2=0) {
		   alert("--output--");
		   } else {
		      alert("--other output--");
		}
		</pre>
	    We could rewrite this as:
		<pre>
	   	if (num1 % 2 == 0){
		   if (num2 % 2 == 0) {
			  if (num3 % 2 == 0) {
				alert("--output--");
			  }
		    }
		} else {
			alert("--other output--");
		}
		</pre>
	<strong>Test the Program:</strong>
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap14();">Compare</button><br><br>
	These nested statements can be useful but also quite tricky. Be careful with closing braces!
	
	<!-- Chapter 15 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 15&mdash;Arrays</h3>
	<p>Another type of variable we can create is an <strong>array</strong>. An array, closed in square brackets, <strong>[ ]</strong>, can have
	   multiple values assigned to it. Each value assigned to an array is also called an <strong>element</strong>.
	</p>
	<h4>Examples:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>var array1</strong> = [num1, num2, num3];</li>
		<li><strong>var array2</strong> = ["Joe", 12, num4];</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each element in an array is assigned a value called its <strong>index</strong>. We can reference elements directly by referencing the array
	   by its index. Let's say our array is declared as follows:</p>
	var array1 = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];<br><br>
	Test this by entering an index number:	   
	<button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap15();">Choose an Index</button><br><br>
	
	<strong>Important: the index value begins with 0, not 1!</strong>
	
	<!-- Chapter 16 -->

	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 16&mdash;Arrays: Adding and Removing Elements</h3>
	<p>Just as we can create an empty variable we can create an empty array with the following syntax:<br><br>
	<strong>var colors = [ ];</strong><br><br>
	We then can assign values to this array by assigning them to the array's indices:<br><br>
	color[0] = "red";<br>color[1] = "orange";<br>color[2] = "yellow";<br>etc.<br><br>
	If we refer to an index that does not already have a value assigned the value will be <strong>undefined</strong>. If we assign a value to
	an index position that already contains a value, the previous value will be overwritten in memory. What if we wish to add or remove a value
	to the end of the array? For that task we have the <strong>pop()</strong> and <strong>push()</strong> methods.<br><br>
	For example, <strong>color.pop();</strong> removes the last element of the color array. We could store this value in a variable:<br><br>
	var goByeBye = color.pop();<br><br>
	If we wish to add an item to the end of our array we use <strong>push(<em>newElement</em>);</strong>:<br><br>
	color.push("blue"); will add blue to the array we assigned values to earlier, in the last position.
	</p>
	<h4>Examples:</h4>
	var array1 = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<button class="swtlbutton" onclick="chap16();">What's My Length?</button><br><br>
	See the result of using array1.pop();
	<button class="swtlbutton" onclick="chap16a();">Pop It!</button><br><br>
	We stored the value of array1.pop(); in a variable in the last example. Click the button to add the contents of that variable to the end of the array:
	<button class="swtlbutton" onclick="chap16b();">Push It Back!</button><br><br>
	
	<!-- Chapter 17 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl" id="Ch17">Chapter 17&mdash;Arrays: Removing and Inserting Elements</h3>
	<p>In this chapter we learn four methods for removing and inserting elements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>shift();</strong>&mdash;removes the first element of an array</li>
		<li><strong>unshift();</strong>&mdash;adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array</li>
		<li><strong>splice();</strong>&mdash;inserts one or more element anywhere in an array; optional: remove one or more elements after the splice</li>
		<li><strong>slice();</strong>&mdash;copies one or more <em>consecutive</em> elements in an array and put them in a new array</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Examples:</h4>
	Given this array: cars = ["Ferrari", "Lamborghini", "Porsche", "MacLaren", "Pagani"];<br><br>
	Press the button to remove the first element and see the new array using <strong>cars.shift();</strong>: 
	<button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap17();">Shift It!</button><br><br>
	Press the button to add a new element to the cars array using <strong>cars.unshift("Aston Martin", "Lotus");</strong> and see the new array:
	<button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap17a();">Unshift Them!</button><br><br>
	Add "Aston Martin" and "Lotus" to the array beginning in the 2nd position and remove the first element after the splice using 
	<strong>cars.splice(1, 1, "Aston Martin", "Lotus");</strong>
	<button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap17b();">Splice Them!</button><br><br>
	Copy the first two elements in our array to a new array and display its contents using <strong>var newCars = cars.slice(0, 2);</strong>:<br>
	<button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap17c();">Slice Them!</button><br><br>
	
	<!-- Chapter 18-->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 18&mdash;<em>for</em> Loops</h3>
	<p>Loops automate functions that would otherwise need tedious coding. Say we want to check if a car the user enters in a prompt is in
	   our array from the previous chapter. We assign the user's entry to a variable and iterate through the array to see if it's there.
	   The structure of this for loop is:<br><br>
	   <pre>
	   for(var i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i++) {
		 if(carOnList === cars[i] {
			alert("It's on the list!");
		 }
	   }
	   </pre>
	   Notes:
	   <ul>
		   <li>The variable <strong>i</strong> counts iterations. It can be initialized to any value, but if we want to begin at the beginning of the array,
			it is assigned 0.</li>
		   <li>The second statement in the parentheses after <em>for</em> defines a limit on the loop. In this case, once the index counter reaches
		    4, the loop ends.</li>
		   <li>The third statement tells the browser how to increment the counter. In this case, 1 is added to i after each iteration, but it could
			 be decremented. It could be multiplied by a number. It's up to the need of the program.</li>
	   </ul>
	   Check to see if the car brand the user is prompted to enter is in the array from Chapter 17:
	   <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap18();">Check and See!</button><br><br>
	
	
	<!-- Chapter 19-->				 
		
	<h3 class = "swtl" id="ch19">Chapter 19&mdash;<em>for</em> Loops: Flags, Booleans, Array Length, and Loopus Interruptus</h3>
	<p>You may have noticed a problem with the loop used in Chapter 18&mdash;if you entered a car not in the array, nothing happened. The user
       doesn't know if they did something wrong or if it was the function. To solve this issue we use a <strong>flag</strong>. A flag is a variable
	   that begins with an assigned value and is then switched to another value if our conditions are met. Say we began the function with this statement:<br><br>
	   <strong>var matchFound</strong> = false; <br><br>
	   We then add a statement inside the loop that reassigns matchFound the value true if a match is found. 
	   <pre>  
	   for(var i=0; i&lt;=4; i++){
	      if(carOnList===cars[i] {
	      matchFound = true;
	      alert("It's on the list!");
	      break;
	      }
	   }
	   </pre>
	   Just below the loop structure we add another
	   if statement:
	   <pre>
	   if(matchFound===false) {
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;alert("It's not on the list.");
	   </pre>
	   Now, if the user enters a car not in the array, a message lets them know so. Try it:
	   <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap19();">Check and See!</button><br><br>
	   If you were reading closely, you noticed a line in the loop that read <strong>break</strong>. This keyword is used to save computing cycles if
	   the function finds a match early in the loop. In such a case, the break keyword halts the loop and lets the CPU get to the next instruction.<br><br>
	   In our function we knew the exact number of elements in the array. What if we didn't? In that case, we would use the .length property of the array. We 
	   could assign: <br><br>
	   <strong>var numElements</strong> = cars.length<br><br>
	   and change the loop exit condition to:<br><br>
	   i &lt;= numElements;<br><br>
	   This produces the same results.
	
		
	<!-- Chapter 20-->				 
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 20&mdash;<em>for</em> Loops Nested</h3>
	<p>We can nest one loop inside another. When we do so, for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs a complete cycle of iterations.
	   After the inner loop has completed its cycle, the outer loop increments and the inner loop starts over. This continues until the outer loop
	   reaches its sentinel value. Let's examine this by creating a band name generator. We'll create three arrays: one for the first word of the band
	   name, one for the second, and an empty array that will be filled with the results of our nested loop.<br><br>
	   <pre>
	   var fNames = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Indigo", "Violet"];
	   var lNames = ["Earth", "Wind", "Fire", "Water"];
	   var bandNames = [];
	   for(var i=0; i &lt; fNames.length; i++) {
	     for(var j=0; j &lt; lNames.length; j++) {
		   bandNames.push(fNames[i] + lNames[j]);
		 }
	   }
	   alert(bandNames);
	   </pre>
	   See the results:
	   <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap20();">Gimme Some Names!</button><br><br>
