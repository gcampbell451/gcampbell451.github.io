	<h3>Chapter 31&mdash;Getting the Current Date and Time</h3>
	<p>To get the current date and time, JavaScript creates a date object with the <strong>Date()</strong> method. It gets this information from
	   the current system time, so the method is only as accurate as the system settings. This object is not a string so string methods will not
	   operate upon it unless we convert it using the <strong>toString()</strong> method.
	</p>
	<pre>
	var dateTime = new Date();
	alert(dateTime);
	</pre>
	What time is it? <button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap31();">Time to Get Ill!</button><br><br>
	To extract the day of the week, we use the <strong>getDay()</strong> method. This returns the day of the week as an index of an array, 0
	representing Sunday through 6 representing Saturday. To convert this index to a string, a little code is necessary:
	<pre>
	var days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
	var today = new Date();
	var date = today.getDay();
	var todaysName = days[date];
	alert("The day of the week is " + todaysName + ".");	
	</pre>
	What is the day of the week? <button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap31a();">What is Today?</button>
	
	<!-- Chapter 32 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 32&mdash;Extracting Parts of the Date and Time</h3>
	<p>JavaScript gives many more methods for extracting parts of the Date object:

	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 33&mdash;Specifying a Date and Time</h3>
	<p>This chapter deals with calculating the amount of time between a reference date and another date. The strategy is to use the
	   <strong>getTime()</strong> method for both dates and subtract them. This leaves the number of milliseconds between the two dates,
	   and we can multiply by whatever conversion factor we want to get the desired unit for the interval. Let's find out how many days
	   between today and the end of this year. We use a specific notation for the date:
	</p>
	<pre>
	var today = new Date();							// Create a date object for today.
	var endOfYear = new Date("December 31, 2020");  	// Note the naming convention on the date. This must be followed exactly.
	var msToday = today.getTime();					// Get ms since 1/1/1970 for today.
	var msEndOfYear = endOfYear.getTime();			// Get ms since 1/1/1970 for the end of this year.
	var msDiff = msEndOfYear - msToday;				// Calculate the difference.
	var days = msDiff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);			// Converts ms into days.
	days = Math.floor(days);							// This rounds the above calculation down to an integer.
	</pre>
	Try it here: <button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap33();">When Will it End?!</button><br><br>
	If we want to specify the time as well, we do so in hh:mm:ss format inside the quotation marks:
	<pre>
	var endOfYear = new Date("December 31, 2020 23:59:59");
	</pre>
	<!-- Chapter 34 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl" id="Chap34">Chapter 34&mdash;Changing Elements of a Date and Time</h3>
	<p>Once we have created a Date object, we can change individual elements of the object as in the following table:
	</p>
	<table class="ch32table">
		<tr>
			<th>Method</th>
			<th>Example ( x = new Date(); )</th>
			<th>Result</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setFullYear()</td>
			<td>x.setFullYear(2021)</td>
			<td>Year of x is 2021</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setMonth()</td>
			<td>x.setMonth(0)</td>
			<td>Month of x is January</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setDate()</td>
			<td>x.setDate(1)</td>
			<td>Day of the month is 1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setHours()</td>
			<td>x.setHours(0)</td>
			<td>Midnight</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setMinutes()</td>
			<td>x.setMinutes(1)</td>
			<td>One minute past the hour</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setSeconds()</td>
			<td>x.setSeconds(1)</td>
			<td>One second past the minute</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>setMilliseconds()</td>
			<td>x.setMilliseconds(1)</td>
			<td>One ms past the second</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	These methods change the individual elements without changing any other element. Say we have the following code:
	<pre>
	var today = new Date();				// Create a Date object.
	today.setFullYear(2021);				// Change the year of the object.
	todaysYear = today.getFullYear();		// Extract the new year of the object.
	</pre>
	See it in action: <button class = "swtlbutton" onclick="chap34();">Let's Do the Time Warp Now!</button><br><br>

	<!-- Chapter 35 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 35&mdash;Functions</h3>
	<p>Functions are blocks of code that we can reuse in multiple places. Functions simplify code overall because we can call them once
	   they are defined instead of rewriting the code each time. Yes, we could copy/paste code, but this would make the code more tedious
	   to read and would require more storage space.
	</p>
	This has been happening in the background every time you have clicked a button on these pages. The button simply calls the function, which
	is stored in a JavaScript file. For example, the code from the previous chapter was displayed as this:
	<pre>
	var today = new Date();				// Create a Date object.
	today.setFullYear(2021);				// Change the year of the object.
	todaysYear = today.getFullYear();		// Extract the new year of the object.
	</pre>
	This code was simply wrapped in a function call in the separate file. In that file, it looks like this:
	<pre>
	function chap34() {
		var today = new Date();				// Create a Date object.
		today.setFullYear(2021);				// Change the year of the object.
		todaysYear = today.getFullYear();		// Extract the new year of the object.
	}	
	</pre>	
	The <strong>function</strong> keyword denotes the beginning of the function. The name of this function is <strong>chap34()</strong>. Functions
	names follow the same rules as variable names. The parenthesis either enclose parameters or are empty if the function does not receive them.
	Once called, the statements inside the curly braces are executed in order. When the ending curly
	brace is reached, the next line of code following it is executed. Functions are called in code like this:
	<pre>
	chap34();
	</pre>
	They can also be used in events (such as button clicks, as we have used them in these pages) like this:
	<pre>
		&lt;button class="swtlbutton" onclick="chap34();"&gt;Let's Do the Time Warp Now!&lt;/button&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<!-- Chapter 36 -->

	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 36&mdash;Functions: Passing Them Data</h3>
	<p>All of the functions we have used to this point have had no arguments. That is, we have not passed any data into the functions. If we
	   wish to pass data into a function we do so with <strong>parameters</strong>. These parameters can be strings, numbers, or variables and
	   are listed, separated by commas, within the parentheses in the function statement:
	</p>
	<pre>
	function functionName(parameter1, parameter2,....) {
	     statements;
	}
	</pre>
	When calling the function, we pass <strong>arguments</strong> into the function. The arguments are passed into the function according to 
	the order they are listed.
	<pre>
	functionName(argument1, argument2,...);
	</pre>
	This function passes arguments entered by the user into an internal function that sums the numbers:
	<pre>
	function chap36() {
		var userNum1 = "Enter a number";
		var defaultAnswer1 = "Enter number here";
		var userNum2 = "Enter another number";
		var defaultAnswer2 = "Enter number here";
		var num1 = parseInt(prompt(userNum1, defaultAnswer1));
		var num2 = parseInt(prompt(userNum2, defaultAnswer2));
		function sum(num1, num2) {
			var sum = num1 + num2;	
			alert("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum + ".");
		}
		sum(num1, num2);
	}
	</pre>
	Try it: <button class="swtlbutton" onclick="chap36(1, 2);">What is the Sum?</button><br><br>
	
	<!-- Chapter 37 -->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 37&mdash;Functions: Passing Data Back from Them</h3>
	<p>We can also pass data back from functions using the <strong>return</strong> keyword. This passes back a <strong><em>single</em></strong> value
	   from the function. We capture this value with a variable and use it as we wish. Using the code from the previous chapter, we alter the interior
	   function as follows:
	</p>
	<pre>
	function sum(num1, num2) {
		return num1 + num2;			// Use return keyword to return the sum
	}
	var total = sum(num1, num2);			// Capture the returned value of the sum function
	alert("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + total + ".");
	</pre>
	*** Note that we no longer need to call <strong>sum</strong>. Its returned value was passed to <strong>chap37()</strong> when we assigned it to <strong>total </strong>.***<br><br>
	Try it: <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap37();">What is the Sum?</button><br><br>
	
	<!-- Chapter 38-->
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 38&mdash;Functions: Local Vs. Global Variables</h3>
	<p>Local and global variables differ in their <strong>scope</strong>. Scope refers to where the variable
	   can be seen by the code. A global variable is declared in the main code whereas a local variable is declared
	   within a function. This local variable cannot be seen outside the function and has no meaning except inside 
	   the function. For example:
	</p>
	<pre>
	function chap38() {
		var global = "Global Scope";
		function chap38a() {
			var local = "Local Scope";
		}
		alert(local);
	}
	</pre>
	Because local is declared inside the inner function it has no meaning to the outer function. <br><br>
	See the result of calling the function: <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap38();">What Will Print?</button><br><br>
	The answer: nothing! We tried to print a string the code can't access. Now we code the same function, changing the variable printed in the alert:
	<pre>
	function chap38b() {
		var global = "Global Scope";
		function chap38a() {
			var local = "Local Scope";
		}
		alert(global);
	}
	</pre>
	What will happen now? <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap38b();">What Will Print?</button>

	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 39&mdash;<em>Switch</em> Statements: How to Start Them</h3>
	<p><strong>Switch</strong> statements are an alternative to <strong>if</strong> statements when we need to 
	   test multiple conditions. An important difference is we cannot use inequalities in the conditions. The
	   general structure is:
	</p>
	<pre>
	switch(variable) {
	case [condition]:
	  statement;
	  break;
	}
	</pre>
	The <strong>break</strong> keyword exits the switch if the condition is met; otherwise the switch moves to
	the next condition to test. Here is a specific example:
	<pre>
	switch(num) {
	case 1:
	  alert("You chose the number one.");
	  break;
	case 2:
	  alert("You chose the number two.");
	  break;
	case 3:
	  alert("You chose the number three.");
	  break;
	case 4:
	  alert("You chose the number four.");
	  break;
	}
	</pre>
	Try it: <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap39();">Which Did You Pick?</button><br><br>
		
	<!-- Chapter 40-->				 
	
	<h3 class = "swtl">Chapter 40&mdash;<em>Switch</em> Statements: How to Complete Them</h3>
	<p>Let's return to the switch from the previous chapter. The <strong>break</strong> keyword was important
	  because JavaScript would continue to execute the statements in the switch without its use, even if the
	  conditions were matched. See what happens when we remove them:
	</p>
	What will happen?  <button class ="swtlbutton" onclick="chap40();">No Breaks!</button><br><br>
	There is another thing to consider: what if none of the conditions match? To cover this possibility we use
	the <strong>default</strong> keyword in this way:
	<pre>
	...
	case n:
	  statement;
	  break;
	default:
	  statement;
	}
	</pre>
	See how this works by intentionally entering a number outside of the requested range.<br><br>
