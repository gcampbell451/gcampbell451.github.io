	<h2>M2B&mdash;Navigate This Course</h2>
	<h3>Items From Main Course Menu</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Content</dt>
			<dd>Clicking this tab brings one to an Overview of the course. It describes what the student will be learning, describes the
				expected takeaways from the course, and gives an indication of how much student effort will be required to successfully complete
				the course. This page is only useful at the beginning of the course and won't be used weekly.</dd>
		<dt>Discussions</dt>
			<dd>This page, unlike the Content page, will get heavy usage. All assignments save weekly quizzes and blog posts are likely to be
			    submitted on this page. Of particular importance is the Class Discussion link, where questions about assignments or questions for
				the instructor in general are posted. As stated on the page, this is the classroom.</dd>
		<dt>Class Progress</dt>
			<dd>This page gives a detailed breakdown of the student's current progress in the course. It is segmented into the relevant menu items
			    from the nav banner. Within each section is a drop-down menu that gives further details about progress in that menu item. This page
				will be helpful in figuring out whether the student has done the proper peer review as the Discussions section of this page lists
				all of the student's authored posts.</dd>	
	</dl>
		<h3>Three Other Items</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>Course Tools</dt>
			<dd>This link pulls up a drop-down list that contains some of the other links on the nav banner in addition to a couple of new ones.
				Most of the links here aren't currently useful or are redundant, but one important one here is the link to the Blog. Since
				we're required to post to the Blog weekly, and this is the only place I've found a link to it, Course Tools will be used at 
				least weekly.</dd>
		<dt>Update Alerts</dt>
			<dd>A button consisting of an image of a bell is located above the nav banner. This button has an orange circle on it when certain events
				occur, such as a grade being updated or a response to one of the student's posts is submitted. This button will make it easier to 
				see when someone has received a response as compared to poking through the Discussions page to find these things out.</dd>
		<dt>Subscription Alerts</dt>
			<dd>This button is just to the left of the Update Alerts button and has similar functionality. The difference is that this button notifies
				the student when a thread they've subscribed to has been updated. (On each post, the student can click a check box to Subscribe to
				that particular thread.)</dd>
