        <h2 class="center">Course Contract</h2> 
        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Gregory C. Campbell</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2021 WEB21 Web Design class with my 
            instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put
            information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such failure to turn in	
            assignments may show as an absence</p>
        <p>Signed, Gregory C. Campbell, 17 August 2021.</p>
