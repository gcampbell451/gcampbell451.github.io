		<ul>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Personal Background:</strong> I was born in Laurinburg, NC and moved to Charlotte when I was three years old.
				After graduating from college I lived with a friend in Philadelphia, PA for five years before returning to Charlotte
				in 2006.</li>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Professional Background:</strong> The reason I moved to Philadelphia was to become a day trader, but my timing was
				not great: my first day trading was 9/10/2001. With the market turmoil and my inexperience in trading, I did not
				last long. I returned to restaurants as a server/bartender as I had supported myself in that industry during college. 
				When I moved back to Charlotte I attempted to find work in another industry but couldn't, so I fell back into the 
				familiar arms of the restaurant. While I am still a server, at Foxcroft Wine Company in SouthPark, I know that my
				days of working on my feet are numbered. This is why I began study at CPCC in Spring semester 2016.</li>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from East Mecklenburg HS, then earned a BA in Chemistry from UNC-Chapel Hill.
				I knew before finishing that I didn't want a careeer in chemistry, but tuition was rising so fast (tripled during my
				college tenure) that I was forced to complete a degree I no longer wanted instead of switching to something else. I 
				enrolled in my first class at CPCC in Spring 2016 and have since earned AAS Networking Technologies and AAS Information
				Assurance/Digital Forensics degrees.</li>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Primary Computer Platform:</strong> After completing CTI 130 in Summer 2016 I built my own PC. Windows 10. Sabretooth 990FX motherboard, 
				 AMD Radeon 8750 chip, 16 GB DDR3 RAM (getting old), 4 GB GE Force GTX 770 graphics card, for those interested.</li>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Courses I'm Taking, & Why:</strong> 
				<ul>
					<li>CIS 115&mdash;I'm taking CIS 115 because I am working towards a Full-Stack Programming degree and this is a required course.</li>
					<li>CSC 154&mdash;I'm taking CSC 154 for the same reason as above.</li>
					<li>MAT 52/152&mdash;These courses satisfy the math requirement for all IT degrees at CPCC.</li>
					<li>WEB 215&mdash;I'm taking WEB 215 because I've enjoyed the other WEB classes I've taken and want to learn more about web
						development. For a demonstration of my commitment to this course one can read my <a href="contract.html" target="_blank">WEB 215 Course Contract</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			<li><strong class="list-item">Something to Remember Me By:</strong> My family is quite musical, and even though I'm one of the less talented of the 
				family, I play piano and guitar.</li>
			<li><strong class="list-item">I'd Also Like to Share:</strong> I spend too much time playing video games for a person of my age. Civilization 6 is my
				current favorite, and Rock Band and Guitar Hero are for obvious reasons perennial favorites.</li>
